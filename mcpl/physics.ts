// The REAL ragdoll for headless bodies.
//
// A WorldAgent has no renderer, but the tumble never needed one: the Verlet
// solver drives bone NODES and emits a sparse quaternion pose — the same pose
// a browser body streams. The fleet test has run this exact solver against
// every shipped VRM headless under Bun since the day it shipped; this module
// gives that machinery to the agents themselves, so a pushed agent TUMBLES —
// simulated on its own side, streamed through its own presence — instead of
// being semantically informed that it fell.
//
// What the agent needs in-process is only its skeleton: joint rest positions
// parsed straight from its VRM's GLB JSON chunk (tools/rig-load.mjs — no
// meshes, no textures, no fs), wrapped in a stand-in Avatar whose normalized
// bone nodes are exactly what Ragdoll drives.
//
// The one piece of ceremony: client/lib/ragdoll.js imports './core.js', which
// builds a WebGPURenderer at import time. Headless callers swap in the test
// stub via a Bun loader plugin — which must be registered BEFORE the dynamic
// import, which is why everything here loads lazily and the module exports
// only async doors. Sim unavailable (plugin failure, unparseable VRM) is a
// soft state: the agent falls back to the slump.
//
// Frame convention: the sim runs in WORLD COORDINATES against the live ground.
// It used to run on flat ground at zero, offset by ONE terrain sample taken at
// the fall site — locally-flat, blind to slopes the body tumbles across and to
// every placed structure, which is how a body released over an elevated floor
// settled through it to the terrain underneath (issue #17). Now the caller
// hands over its terrain height function (setHeightField — the same generator
// the browsers run, replicated in agent.ts) and registers support boxes for
// placed entities (registerSupport, fed from the server's /geom summaries);
// Ragdoll's own _terrain()/_world() clamps then see exactly what a browser's
// would. Walls of room-scale interiors remain a browser-side concern — data
// boxes carry floors, not architecture (see colliders.fitSupportBox).
//
// Declared seam: terrain and the collider map are MODULE state in the client
// libs, so one process serves ONE world's geometry. Agents co-resident in a
// process share it (every current harness runs one world per process); the
// caller re-asserts its height field before each begin() so at least the
// terrain is always the last faller's truth.

// body) and "does my arm get there" (measureChain/solveChain on its own).
// Both run on rig-load stand-ins here — no mesh, no renderer.
//
// One honest limitation, stated rather than hidden: a browser derives
// landmarks by raycasting the actual mesh (client/lib/landmarks.js); a
// stand-in has no mesh, so contact() uses the derivation's own FALLBACK rule
// (proportionally off the bone, along the approach direction). The two agree
// to a few centimetres — good enough for "did my hand arrive" and for the
// reply an agent reads, while every browser still renders against its own
